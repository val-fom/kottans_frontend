# Kottans frontend course

 ## **Task 0**

Learning these materials helped me to systematize my knowledge about Git and GitHub.
Before that I've learned them through watching disjointed screencasts, googling and reading manuals.
Sarah's 'concept map' really helps me to understand it better.

Also performing tasks forced me to learn some new commands. Even not only from this materials,
such as: `git commit --amend`, `git rebase --interactive HEAD~n`, `git push --force`, etc.

Git and GitHub are very powerful developer tools.

 ## **Task 1**

- [Linux Command Line Basics (screenshot)](/task_1/Linux_Command_Line_Basics.png)
- [Configuring Linux Web Servers (screenshot)](/task_1/Configuring_Linux_Web_Servers.png)
- [Networking for Web Developers (screenshot)](/task_1/Networking_for_Web_Developers.png)

I think more then 90% of information in these courses was totally new for me.

- [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

_new:_ list of status codes in server responds  
_surprised:_ that 'The request and response messages are mostly the same, except for the first line and message headers'  
_to use:_ at least one of the named server-side frameworks  

- [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

_new:_ Identification and Authentication  
_surprised:_ persistent and parallel connections which are default in HTTP/1.1  
_to use:_ Cache Control Headers 

 ## **Task 2**

- [Version Control with Git (screenshot)](task_2/Version_Control_with_Git.png)

This course better explains Git. Especially branching, merging and undoing changes.  
PS: And a funny phrase to my vocabulary - _"easy-peasy"_ :P  

- [GitHub & Collaboration (screenshot)](task_2/GitHub_n_Collaboration.png)

From this course I've got better explanation of how tricky the `git rebase` command is. And what is the order of a collaboration.
