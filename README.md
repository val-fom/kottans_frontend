# Kottans frontend course

 ## **Task 0**

Learning these materials helped me to systematize my knowledge about Git and GitHub.
Before that I've learned them through watching disjointed screencasts, googling and reading manuals.
Sarah's 'concept map' really helps me to understand it better.

Also performing tasks forced me to learn some new commands. Even not only from this materials,
such as: `git commit --amend`, `git rebase --interactive HEAD~n`, `git push --force`, etc.

Git and GitHub are very powerful developer tools.
